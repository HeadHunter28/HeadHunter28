# Hey, I'm Shivang. 
and I am Python developer in the realm of Data Science.  

Learning and mastering **ML/DL/LLM**, I build awesome projects along the way.

### üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What am I currently up to üõ†?
---
- Finished revising the fundamental concepts of deep learning.

- Learning fine-tuning of LLMs, for my next project.

- Wrote an [article](https://github.com/HeadHunter28/all_articles/blob/e179662bee6e77849faba7a00ef8213c8d852f5c/Deep%20Learning/Building%20CNN%20with%20TensorFlow%20and%20Python.pdf) on building CNNs and transfer learning models for image classification tasks.

### ‚≠ê Notable Projects* (updating):
---
- [ChatPandas]* : I love Pandas, but I will jump at the first opportunity to avoid writing boilerplate-ish code for data analysis and pre-processing. This chatbot will be that opportunity.
- [DocQueryBot](https://llmdocumentquerybot-mmmqkmbxzzy2lezrcmdmhe.streamlit.app/) : A RAG LLM-based bot that can accept any document (PDF/DOCX/CSV/XLS) and answer any of your questions about it. <u>(Deployed privately on Streamlit)</u>
- [Resume Analysis Assistance App](https://resumeselectionapp-a6xnjcg5osjq6xr3arzmzr.streamlit.app/) : Compare the suitability of multiple resumes against a given job description. <u>(Deployed privately on Streamlit)</u>
- [UFC Events (1993-2023) - Data Analysis](https://github.com/HeadHunter28/UFC-Events-Data-project)
- [Cards image classification - using CNN and Transfer Learning model](https://github.com/HeadHunter28/DeepLearning/tree/main/Cards%20images%20classification)
-
